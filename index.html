  <h2>Our Journey</h2>
  <p>
    Little Bean Farm & Rescue is in its beginning stages.
    We are currently preparing land, resources, and care plans
    so that when animals arrive, we are ready to give them the
    safest and happiest life possible.

  <p>
    Every rescue starts somewhere. This is ours.

  <h2>About Little Bean</h2>
  <p>
    Little Bean Farm & Rescue is being created as a safe, loving space for animals
    who need a second chance. Our goal is to rescue, protect, and care for animals
    who have been neglected, abandoned, or are simply unwanted.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe every animal — no matter how small — deserves kindness, dignity,
    and a life free from harm.
